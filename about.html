                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm <strong>Madihah Khan</strong>, a passionate 2nd year Software Engineering student with a love for <strong>coding, solving problems</strong> (which can be seen in my love for Lego!), and <strong>building creative digital solutions</strong>. I enjoy exploring new technologies and <strong>constantly challenging myself</strong> to improve and expand my skill set.
                </p>
                <p> I donâ€™t limit myself to a particular area within software engineering because I believe in learning all aspects of the field. From front-end design and user experience to back-end development and data management, I enjoy <strong>gaining a comprehensive understanding</strong> of how software works. This approach allows me to <strong>develop versatile skills</strong> and tackle projects from multiple angles, <strong>ensuring both functional and aesthetically pleasing results</strong>.
                </p>
                <p> Beyond coding, i have a variety of different interests ranging from reading, going to the gym, researching neuroscience and listening to true crime podcasts. I take pride in my work and always ensure that <strong>i put my best effort in throughout everything that i do</strong>. My ultimate goal is to <strong>contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact</strong> while continuously learning and growing as a developer.
